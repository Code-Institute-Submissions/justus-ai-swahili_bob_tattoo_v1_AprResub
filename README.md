##  User Experience (UX)
### User stories
First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor,should be immediately be able to see that the website services are not just limited to tattoos.The use of the words all products , gives a sense that there is more  prodcuts than the name suggests.
As a First Time Visitor, I want the user to be  able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.this is with the help of the search box at the top of the page, with the use of the friedly name shirt in my search box, all products with the name shirt in it shop up in the list so the user can have avsiual on which of these items amonst my collection , they would prefer:

an addtion to the feaures, is the ability to choose items according to their sizes ,in ascending , descending of price and according to the value of the stars :

For every page that the user scrolls , whether on large screen or small screen, as soon as you get to the bottom there is an arrow pointing upawrd ,to enhance ux:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/159146774-06f1660e-b2e9-4497-9cb2-370a792c221b.png)

Hopefully the user will be willing to register and be able to have an easier time adding their details by just confirmingthem  after they make a purchase in the online store.The sign up details below can be saved and reused when the same use logs in again:

 if the user registers with a preexisting username or email, an error message will be displayed and the input boxes turn red , therefore informing the user thtat they have to enter a new , unique set of details as shown below:

 When Making purchases as suggested by the information banner below the navbar, all purchases over 50 dollars won't be charged a delivery fee.This is further highlighted when the user gets to the checkout box using a highlight yellow alert that shows the balance left before making it to the 50 dollar mark to encourage the shoppers to go back add to their shopping bag:
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/159145170-a86362c0-3492-4495-a8f7-9f54561d4530.png)
Once the value spent in the shopping bag is higher than 50 dollars , the yellow highled box dissapears:

Returning Visitor Goals
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

These are clearly shown in the banner message.
They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.
Frequent User Goals
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link
As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.
Further Testing
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
Known Bugs
On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.
## Deployment
This Project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps, first i installed heroku from www.heroku.com and followed the following steps:

First we need to install unicorn, which will act as our webserver.
And freeze that into our requirements file.
Now we can create our Procfile.
To tell Heroku to create a web dyno.
Which will run unicorn and serve our django app.
Last we need to temporarily disable collectstatic.
By using Heroku config set, disable collectstatic equals 1
So that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy.
And we'll need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py
I'll also add localhost in here so that gitpod will still work too.
But with all that saved we can attempt to deploy our app, by adding and committing our changes.
Pushing to github with git push.
And then using git push Heroku master to deploy to Heroku.
So our app is deployed, all be it without any static files but we'll fix that later.
Let's set it up to automatically deploy when we push to github.
I'll go to my app in Heroku. And on the deploy tab set it to connect to github.
Search for my repository.
And then click connect.
With that finished we can enable automatic deploys.
And now every time we push to github.
Our code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.

##Future edits
I would like to add links to social media such as fb and instagram , was not able to do that because of time .
I would also like to fully authenticate the app so it can actually be able to recieve real payments.
