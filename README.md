# SWAHILI BOB TATTOO
View the project live here : https://swahili-bob-tattoo.herokuapp.com/


This website is an online store that primarily deals with tattoos of different kinds.The website categorieses the different types of tatttoos to as close a version of a commodity as possible.Understandably tatttoos are hard to class as they are unique to each individual, but with the pictorial dispaly of previously done tattoos , the website tries to make the task of choice easier.
There is also other products such as piercings and merchandise that go along with the brand as part of the swahili bob business for those who are interested in more than just the tatttoos.
It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential customers and existing customers.
Below is a screenshot of the website on full screen and on mobile size screen-

The website is responsive and with the help  of the hamburger icon that replaces the navbar for small screens, it looks as shown below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/163917348-ee266048-5d34-422c-aa13-c719a6d76596.png) 
On clicking the humburger icon , the navbar cascades downwards to reveal the navbar with the same functions as the full screen navbar:

##  User Experience (UX)
First Time Visitor Goals
1. As a First Time Visitor,should be immediately be able to see that the website services are not just limited to tattoos.The use of the words all products , broadens the spectrum of items to choose from outside of tattoos.
2. A call to action in bold to get your tattoo [](https://swahili-bob-tattoo.herokuapp.com/) now shows where one other click can direct you to the body of prodcuts avalaible in the tattoo store.
3. As a First Time Visitor , the search box at the top of the page, helps the new user find a correlating word to match his/hers word entered ,that way narrowing down their search instead og going through the whole product list.

4. Furthermore the ability to choose items according to their sizes ,in ascending , descending of price and according to the value of how many stars  they got  as shown in the printscreen below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/159145958-721bf7bc-41b5-4b3d-b72c-87050defc922.png)

5. For every page that the user scrolls , whether on large screen or small screen, as soon as you get to the bottom there is an arrow pointing upward to navigate the user back to the top of the page intead of scrolling upwards all over again ,to enhance ux:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/159146774-06f1660e-b2e9-4497-9cb2-370a792c221b.png)
6. the shopping bag , has the option to add and  remove items, whenever the customer decided to change the contents  in their respective shopping bags.This is with the help of an green text add button and red text remove button.
7. When the user is done with thier shoppoing there is a summarry of all prodcuts , they would have chosen i their shopping bag as well as the total for them to be able to see al their purchases.

8. Hopefully the user will be willing to register and be able to have an easier process auto adding their details for their next visit to my website by just confirming their details  after they make a purchase in the online store.The sign up details below can be saved and reused when the same user logs in again:

 9. if the user registers with a preexisting username or email, an error message will be displayed and the input boxes turn red , therefore informing the user thtat they have to enter a new , unique set of details as shown below:

 10. When Making purchases as suggested by the information banner below the navbar, all purchases over 50 dollars won't be charged a delivery fee.This is further highlighted when the user gets to the checkout box using a highlight yellow alert that shows the balance left before making it to the 50 dollar mark to encourage the shoppers to go back add to their shopping bag:
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83753891/159145170-a86362c0-3492-4495-a8f7-9f54561d4530.png)
11. Once the value spent in the shopping bag is higher than 50 dollars , the yellow highlighted box dissapears:

## Returning Visitor Goals
To be able to keep the website images of the latest tattooos at the forfront , like adding a whats new button .

## Known Bugs
I struggled with editing the size of the newsletter for it to fit without hanging put of the screen.
## Deployment
This Project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps, first i installed heroku from www.heroku.com and followed the following steps:

First we need to install unicorn, which will act as our webserver.
And freeze that into our requirements file.
Now we can create our Procfile.
To tell Heroku to create a web dyno.
Which will run unicorn and serve our django app.
Last we need to temporarily disable collectstatic.
By using Heroku config set, disable collectstatic equals 1
So that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy.
And we'll need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py
I'll also add localhost in here so that gitpod will still work too.
But with all that saved we can attempt to deploy our app, by adding and committing our changes.
Pushing to github with git push.
And then using git push Heroku master to deploy to Heroku.
So our app is deployed, all be it without any static files but we'll fix that later.
Let's set it up to automatically deploy when we push to github.
I'll go to my app in Heroku. And on the deploy tab set it to connect to github.
Search for my repository.
And then click connect.
With that finished we can enable automatic deploys.
And now every time we push to github.
Our code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.

##Future edits
I would like to add links to social media such as fb and instagram , was not able to do that because of time .
I would also like to fully authenticate the app so it can actually be able to recieve real payments.
